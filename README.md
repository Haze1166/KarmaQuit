# KarmaQuit
> A gamified mobile app to help users quit smoking through social leaderboards and charitable donations.

## 🧠 Core Concept

KarmaQuit transforms the difficult journey of quitting smoking into a motivational game. Instead of just tracking progress, it creates a real-time feedback loop based on your daily choices.

- **Resist an Urge?** → Get **+1 Point** & climb the leaderboard.
- **Give in to an Urge?** → Get **-1 Point**.
- **The Karma Hook:** When you resist, you get the option to donate the money you saved to a verified cancer patient or research fund.
