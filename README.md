## 🧠 The Vision: Turn Willpower into Superpower

KarmaQuit is a mobile app concept designed to transform the lonely, difficult journey of quitting smoking into a motivational, social, and altruistic game. Instead of just tracking stats, it uses psychological drivers like competition, loss aversion, and purpose to create a powerful, positive feedback loop.

## ✨ Key Features (As Showcased on the Landing Page)

-   **🎯 Gamified Scoring:** A simple `+1` / `-1` point system for every urge you face.
-   **🏆 Social Leaderboards:** Compete with friends, your local community, and users globally.
-   **❤️ Karma Donations:** Turn your willpower into a real-world good deed by donating saved money to cancer funds.
-   **🤖 AI-Powered Coach:** A planned 24/7 AI companion to provide motivation and support during cravings.
-   **📊 Progress Analytics:** Visualize your journey with stats on money saved, health regained, and personal triggers.
-   **Interactive "Live Lung":** A visual representation of your healing journey that rewards your progress.
